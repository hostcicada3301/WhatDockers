# WhatDockers

## What is Docker?
The word "DOCKER" refers to several things. This includes an open source community project; tools from the open source project; Docker Inc., the company that is the primary supporter of that project; and the tools that the company formally supports. The fact that the technologies and the company share the same name can be confusing.

## Working of Docker

The Docker technology uses the Linux kernel and features of the kernel, like Cgroups and namespaces, to segregate processes so they can run independently. This independence is the intention of containers‐the ability to run multiple processes and apps separately from one another to make better use of your infrastructure while retaining the security you would have with separate systems.

Container tools, including Docker, provide an image-based deployment model. This makes it easy to share an application, or set of services, with all of their dependencies across multiple environments. Docker also automates deploying the application (or combined sets of processes that make up an app) inside this container environment.

## Docker Platform for Digital Transformation
Innovation in today’s organizations comes from software, where all companies are becoming software companies and need to empower their developers to deliver new customer experiences quickly. Innovation can come in many different application formats - from traditional, monolithic applications to cloud-native and 12-factor applications.

These applications must also be able to run across hybrid/multi-cloud and out to the edge. Docker enables organizations to achieve these goals by providing the only end-to-end (desktop to the data center) experience for developing and scaling distributed applications while leveraging the processes, people and tools that they have in place today. In addition to building and running applications, the Docker Platform provides end-to-edge security at scale, without slowing down innovation with automated governance and compliance throughout the application lifecycle.

The Docker platform is built on industry-standard, open source technologies including Docker and Kubernetes. Used by millions of developers and IT professionals worldwide, Docker includes the world's leading container content library and ecosystem with more than 100,000 container images from major software vendors, open-source projects and the community.
