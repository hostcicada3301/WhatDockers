# WhatDockers

## What is Docker?
The word "DOCKER" refers to several things. This includes an open source community project; tools from the open source project; Docker Inc., the company that is the primary supporter of that project; and the tools that the company formally supports. The fact that the technologies and the company share the same name can be confusing.

## Working of Docker

The Docker technology uses the Linux kernel and features of the kernel, like Cgroups and namespaces, to segregate processes so they can run independently. This independence is the intention of containers‚Äêthe ability to run multiple processes and apps separately from one another to make better use of your infrastructure while retaining the security you would have with separate systems.

Container tools, including Docker, provide an image-based deployment model. This makes it easy to share an application, or set of services, with all of their dependencies across multiple environments. Docker also automates deploying the application (or combined sets of processes that make up an app) inside this container environment.
